The company has faced challenges related to rising costs associated with H-1B visa applications, now at $100,000, which impacts its ability to hire foreign talent. Additionally, Microsoft has been part of a broader trend among tech giants postponing commitments to hyperscale data center leases in response to heightened trade tensions, reflecting the uncertainty in the current regulatory environment.",

A second element of a strategy is to push major chip buyers-Apple, Samsung, Dell, HP, Sony, and others-to prioritize American fabs.

However, this trend is not expected to be sustainable. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company's problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.",
