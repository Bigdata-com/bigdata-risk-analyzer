Many industries face regulatory and operational requirements that demand on-prem deployments. Yet building and managing AI infrastructure at scale is complex and slow to deliver ROI. With Gcore AI Cloud Stack, we remove those barriers by providing a complete reference architecture, operational blueprint, and cloudification software solution encompassing from IaaS to MaaS. This enables organizations to transform accelerated computing resources into performant cloud environments quickly and at scale, accelerating their AI adoption, deployment, and profit.\"",

This promises lasting impact from the treatment. For instance, Sanofi, a healthcare and pharmaceutical company from France, revealed in July 2025 that the US FDA had granted a fast track designation for SAR446597. This is an intravitreal gene therapy administered via a single dose to treat geographic atrophy (GA), a consequence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

In addition, travel restrictions hindered the deployment of 5G networks in some regions. As the global economy recovers, the 5G equipment industry is expected to rebound, spurred by continued digital transformation efforts and a renewed focus on resilient, high-capacity communication networks. Further, the pandemic has served as a catalyst, emphasizing the critical role of 5G technology in fostering connectivity and enabling businesses and communities to thrive in a rapidly changing world. For instance, in September 2023, Siemens launched a private 5G infrastructure developed in-house for industry users. The solution enables industrial companies to build their own local 5G networks that provide optimal support for automation applications. 5G is crucial for applications such a mobile robots, autonomous logistics, and driverless transport systems in factories. Consequently. this 5G infrastructure provides users sole control over the data in their 5G network, and they can custom-configure the network for their applications.",

In areas where trailers are mostly used for business, this is not the case. Here, consumer demand has been driven by recreational and lifestyle needs. OEMs like Ford, GM, and Ram were the first to make mass-market tools like Pro Trailer Backup Assist, multi-angle trailer cameras, and integrated steering controls. These tools are now standard in pickups and SUVs. Agencies like NHTSA and FMCSA helped make safety and integration even better. The North American auto market is mostly focused on trucks, so it's not surprising that pickups are still the main platform for trailer assist innovation. In addition to steering aids, OEMs are creating complete ecosystems that include tire pressure monitoring, clear views of trailers, and digital dashboard integration. Recreational activities like boating, camping, and owning an RV keep driving up demand, making trailer assist a necessity for most people instead of a luxury.",

More than a dozen car makers have been alleged to have used technology on diesel vehicles made from 2009 onwards to manipulate emissions tests. The claim is the largest of its kind in English history, with the High Court previously told it is believed to be worth at least Â£6billion. The trial will initially focus on diesel vehicles made by Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Nissan, Renault and the Stellantis-owned brands Peugeot and Citroen said to have been fitted with unlawful 'defeat devices'. These devices detected when vehicles were being tested and ensured emissions were kept within legal limits but did not do so when the cars were on the road, the claimants' lawyers say. The manufacturers, however, say the claims are fundamentally flawed and reject any similarity with the scandal that erupted in 2015, which cost Volkswagen billions in fines and compensation.",

An interesting piece of research led by Phuong et al (2019) throws some insights into silence-crisis communication diaspora. The researchers assessed eight real international cases to understand how silence worked as a crisis communication strategy and found that a well-defined, time-stamped silence helped the organisations preserve their reputation even during the silence. According to the qualitative research on strategic silence and global crisis communication strategy, business strategists can use avoiding silence (e.g., avoiding meeting people), hiding silence (e.g., hiding necessary information from significant stakeholders) and delaying silence (e.g., buying time). But, at the same time, Volkswagen's \"keeping silent\" strategy during the famous emission scandal was found to create only strong negative emotions among several stakeholders. Though these claims are seemingly paradoxical, they provide one important lesson to consider taking forward. Make sure you timestamp the silence. Prolonged silence may kill the purpose of strategic silence.",

More than a dozen car makers have been alleged to have used technology on diesel vehicles made from 2009 onwards to manipulate emissions tests. The claim is the largest of its kind in English history, with the High Court previously told it is believed to be worth at least Â£6billion. The trial will initially focus on diesel vehicles made by Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Nissan, Renault and the Stellantis-owned brands Peugeot and Citroen said to have been fitted with unlawful 'defeat devices'. These devices detected when vehicles were being tested and ensured emissions were kept within legal limits but did not do so when the cars were on the road, the claimants' lawyers say.
