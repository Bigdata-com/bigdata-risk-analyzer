They optimize space and reduce cooling costs through advanced in-row cooling techniques and rigorous airflow management, which collectively enhance the overall energy efficiency, lowering the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and operational expenses. The standardization of components simplifies maintenance, boosts reliability, and supports a seamless service model enhancing customer satisfaction. Additionally, the integration of Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) systems in these modular setups allows for effective monitoring and operational control, ensuring maximum performance and uptime.

This approach offers solutions to operational constraints and adaptive responsiveness to market changes through competitive advantages such as reduced transaction costs, the ability to focus on core business, and risk distribution among chain members [7,21,22,23]. On the other hand, organizing into complex supply chains also represents an increase in the interdependence of those involved and, consequently, an increased risk of significant losses in productivity and revenue. Therefore, proactively detecting and managing risks has also become an essential part of the supply chain environment [2,24,25,26]. Several recent examples demonstrate the effects of this interdependence, such as the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which disrupted several global supply chains.

In January of last year, CNBC reported that due to the global transition to green energy, the price of copper could rise by over 75% in 2025. Indeed, Goldman Sachs noted at the time that a supply deficit exceeding half a million tons could materialize later in 2024, primarily due to mining disruptions. Though it's easy to point the finger at the political realm, it's not the only catalyst for the commodity. Instead, multiple elements have converged, bolstering interest in the market. Financial services company Sprott Inc.  introduced exchange-traded funds with exposure to copper miners.

And AI is several things. AI is energy, AI is chips, the models and the applications. And so you could see Nvidia, and you could look at me working across that entire stack of ecosystems around the world. And we need more energy.
