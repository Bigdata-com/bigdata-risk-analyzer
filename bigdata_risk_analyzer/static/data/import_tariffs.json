A second element of a strategy is to push major chip buyers-Apple, Samsung, Dell, HP, Sony, and others-to prioritize American fabs.

Ro Khanna, speaking in past interviews, has publicly described the present tariff regime as anachronistic, framing Trump's approach as rooted in 19th-century protectionism ill suited to the modern global economy.

More recently, he threatened to levy a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., criticising Apple's decision to scale up production in India instead of repatriating it. For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Apple's growing presence has become a symbol of India's ambition to emerge as a global electronics manufacturing hub. Apple's early foray with Wistron in Bengaluru faced labour unrest in 2020 over wage disputes. Apple's shift is also driving a gradual localisation of its supply chain. \"Apple is now trying to build highly localised partners in India to become truly diversified,\" Shah said. \"But replicating China's component ecosystem will take time.",

The recent speculation about tariff relief for US automakers could affect short-term profit margins, potentially easing a key headwind, but ongoing uncertainty around trade agreements remains the most critical risk to near-term performance. If the policy shift does not materialize, it is unlikely to immediately alter the biggest catalyst for GM, which continues to be affordable EV adoption.",

Western companies cannot call in Chinese technicians anymore, nor can they import the precision equipment that forms the backbone of metallization and magnet manufacturing processes. Every alloy caster, every furnace, every extraction column will have to be designed anew.\nIn theory, American and European manufacturers could step in. Firms like Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) or Alfa Laval AB (STO: ALFA) know how to make high-grade chemical process systems. But designing rare-earth-enabled product manufacturing equipment is not like building stainless-steel tanks for pharmaceuticals. These systems operate at corrosive extremes of acidity and temperature, and the materials of construction-corrosion-resistant metals and alloys, fluoropolymer-lined alloys, ceramic crucibles, graphite reaction chambers-must be matched to specific rare earth chemistries. Getting those specifications wrong is not a minor error; it is catastrophic.",

        "quote": "For agricultural shippers, the anticipated benefits are encouraging. By eliminating interchange delays between separate railroads, the unified network will expedite grain deliveries and reduce transit times on key routes. Currently, a load of corn or soybeans from Minnesota might switch carriers en-route to the Southeast or East Coast, adding complexity and days of transit, which ultimately make for less trade on those routes. With Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern combined, that same load can move end-to-end on one railroad, arriving at feed mills or processing plants with fewer handoffs and lower risk of delay. Likewise, inbound shipments of fertilizer and other farm inputs will travel more directly, helping CFS ensure timely supply for its members during critical planting and harvest seasons. Overall, a unified transcontinental railroad promises a dependable, cost-effective supply chain for agriculture - an industry where rail already handles over 3.2 million carloads of grain and oilseeds annually.",
